# Predicting-Lung-Cancer-the-Smart-Way
ðŸ§  Project Description

Project that describes end-to-end predictive model development to identify lung cancer using Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Ensemble Models. Relying on a 1,000 patients' database of demographic, environmental, lifestyle, and clinical factors, it is the task to identify the risk levels for lung cancer accurately as Low, Medium, and High.

The process steps are feature scaling, data preprocessing, label encoding, and multi-class classification. Some of the models were developed and tested:

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF).

Deep Learning Models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Performance Evaluation: The models were assessed with accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC curves.

Remarkably, the CNN model was 100% accurate, beating other models, and demonstrating the capability of deep learning to diagnose medical conditions. The project demonstrates how hybrid AI techniques can be utilized to assist in early detection and accurate classification of lung cancer stages, and potentially applied to real-time clinical decision-making.
